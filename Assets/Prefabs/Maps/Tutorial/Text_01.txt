In main building you can create new units but to train them, you have to have enough gold.
To earn gold you have to occupy fields like Villages and Gold Mines. They generate income every turn.
There is another way to spend gold. You can build buildings. Just tap on occupied field to see what can you create.
As you can see, units can be join into groups(except heroes). Remember that group is much stronger than single unit.
Main buildings have additional skill, same as villages, regenerate health every turn.
