Trynda;Brother, we have to head back to the capital.
Darek;I'm a bit disappointed. I was really looking forward to next battle.
Trynda;You won't ask why we have to abandon our invasion.
Darek;Surprise me.
Trynda;We have been attacked by dark forces.
Darek;That was kind of unexpected.
Darek;You heard us Lexand? Dark times. Dark forces. This kind of things.
Darek;We have to unit to protect humanity. Let's forget about old discords and join fight against our common enemy... The Darkness himself... or herself... maybe itself.
Garam;Old? You betrayed us today.
Darek;The mists of history.
Garam;No, we won't help you.
Darek;Okay, I tried.
Trynda;What's now?
Darek;Now, we're going home. To the North West.
Darek;No, wait. To the North!
Darek;Yeah, that sounds much better.
