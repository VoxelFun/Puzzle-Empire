Darek;Let's be serious for a moment. What happened?
Trynda;Ship happened. We have been attacked by the most evil lord of Darkness, son of Death, Lord Zaratholouxus.
Darek;You mean this the most evil lord of Darkness, son of Death, Lord Zaratholouxus?
Trynda;Yes, it's him.
Darek;I never heard.
Piesek;Ordinary mortals! I'm the most evil lord of Darkness, son of Death, Lord Zaratholouxus and I'm here to take my revenge.
Darek;Yep, still nothing.
Piesek;I spent many years on this lands. I even called this place home.
Darek;And now we're waiting for "but".
Piesek;BUT humans betrayed me and tried to kill. Everything because of stupid fear of my powers...
Darek;Fortunately they were wrong.
Piesek;...and now my time, for revenge, has come!
Darek;I thought that this story will be more interesting.
Piesek;It is but we can't talk to much before the battle. My army will frost to death. Hahaha... haha...
Piesek;Do you understand? They are already cold and dead.
Darek;I get that part.
Piesek;Good.
